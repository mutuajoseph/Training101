# Tuples are similar to lists but the main difference between the two is that one cannot change it at any case
# In a tuple we do use parenthesis
# Index does return the position of an element in a tuple
daysOfTheWeek = ("M","T","W","T","F","S","S")
print(daysOfTheWeek.index("S"))

# Tuples are used in scenarios where by you dont want anyone to manipulate it at any case
# Type casting is also used to manipulate between tuples and lists
